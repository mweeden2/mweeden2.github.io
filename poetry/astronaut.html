  <h3>
   astronaut
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I am probably the worst astronaut.
   <br/>
   Sometimes I get around to adding more
   <br/>
   Duct tape to keep my rocket rudders on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But though the moon is just a candle now,
   <br/>
   It's up there and giving a little warmth.
   <br/>
   In the End, I'll stand in that nightly day.
