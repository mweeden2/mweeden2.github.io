   sleeping
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Three days is not too long.
   <br/>
   Not as long as, say, seven (or eight).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I wonder if it was three when
   <br/>
   The good faries put the whole
   <br/>
   Kingdom to sleep before Philip went
   <br/>
   Down and slew the dragon
   <br/>
   And with a kiss slew death,
   <br/>
   Which is really just a sleep.
