   weilding wrong
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Babies know, and 5-year-olds too.
   <br/>
   Something is wrong here, and it's killing them.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But they don't know what we know,
   <br/>
   How to grasp and turn it from smoke to a stick.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They suffer openly and full of pain.
