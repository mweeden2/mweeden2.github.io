running into the street

I chase him about every day;
He knows well the thrill of being
Snatched up at the last moment.

There was another boy
Who was playing ball in the parking lot.
He got dog poop on his shorts
And got killed for that too.

It's the pure joy on his face
As he met the on-coming car,
The joy blind to the coming slaughter
That breaks my heart again and again.
