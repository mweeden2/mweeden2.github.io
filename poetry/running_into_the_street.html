   running into the street
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I chase him about every day;
   <br/>
   He knows well the thrill of being
   <br/>
   Snatched up at the last moment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was another boy
   <br/>
   Who was playing ball in the parking lot.
   <br/>
   He got dog poop on his shorts
   <br/>
   And got killed for that too.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It's the pure joy on his face
   <br/>
   As he met the on-coming car,
   <br/>
   The joy blind to the coming slaughter
   <br/>
   That breaks my heart again and again.
