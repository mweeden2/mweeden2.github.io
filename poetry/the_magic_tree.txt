Too Much Go

I've been stressed and playing more,
But only the fast games and during work.

I've not slept quite enough, and now,
Shortly after breaking in with an audible word,

What's real becomes half stones in my mind,
Somehow always with bad aji (after-taste).

When it's time, the Our Father comes.
Ah, yes. There's good shape, at least available if not played.
