  <h3>
   trees
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   For many secret years these tress have stood,
   <br/>
   Before this window was. Today they take
   <br/>
   Their post again, assenting to the shape
   <br/>
   Of winds fulfilling errands in the wood.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These clouds diffuse the burning lamp that would
   <br/>
   Have rendered half the leaves, with half opaque,
   <br/>
   More varied now than under shining weight,
   <br/>
   As greenly rich as some might call their goods.
