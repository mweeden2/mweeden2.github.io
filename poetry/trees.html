        Trees
    </h3>
    <p>
        For many secret year these tress have stood,
        <br/> Before this window was. Today they take
        <br/> Their post again, assenting to the shape
        <br/> Of winds fulffilling errands in the wood.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> These clouds diffuse the burning lamp that would
        <br/> Have rendered half the leaves, with half opaque,
        <br/> More varied now than under shining weight,
        <br/> As greenly rich as some might call their goods.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> For it is these that guard the squirrel from dog.
        <br/> In Spring they bloom so bees can feed the hives.
        <br/> They favor ferns by blocking floor from sun.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/> The birds and men will us the twig and log
        <br/> When, dying, these sustain such varied lives,
        <br/> When one is done and many have begun.
        <br/>
