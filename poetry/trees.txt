Trees

For many secret year these tress have stood,
Before this window was. Today they take
Their post again, assenting to the shape
Of winds fulfilling errands in the wood.

These clouds diffuse the burning lamp that would
Have rendered half the leaves, with half opaque,
More varied now than under shining weight,
As greenly rich as some might call their goods.
