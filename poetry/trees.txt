Trees

For many secret year these tress have stood,
Before this window was. Today they take
Their post again, assenting to the shape
Of winds fulfilling errands in the wood.

These clouds diffuse the burning lamp that would
Have rendered half the leaves, with half opaque,
More varied now than under shining weight,
As greenly rich as some might call their goods.

For it is these that guard the squirrel from dog.
In Spring they bloom so bees can feed the hives.
They favor ferns by blocking floor from sun.

The birds and men will us the twig and log
When, dying, these sustain such varied lives,
When one is done and many have begun.
