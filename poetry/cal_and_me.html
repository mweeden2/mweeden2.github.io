   cal and me
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   We are Cain and Abel, but only in appearances.
   <br/>
   More like Cal and Aaron.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He lurks in the night,
   <br/>
   Comes to know those there,
   <br/>
   Finds his mother.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I never lost my mother,
   <br/>
   Seeing less in the daylight.
   <br/>
   The cherub.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I can at least step closer;
   <br/>
   Maybe some good will rub off.
