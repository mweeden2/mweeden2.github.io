  <h3>
   tree climbing
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   A tree can put my head above my house.
   <br/>
   Then I can see past it, over it's head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The climb takes mostly attention. I hang
   <br/>
   Just a bit crooked, waiting for the sun.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   I find that I can't really watch him rise.
   <br/>
   It's light needs more clouds for my kind of face.
