   stevie's flaps
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   My friend Stevie watched his TV
   <br/>
   So much that his cheeks became flabby.
   <br/>
   They bounced as he walked and waved as he talked,
   <br/>
   And he completely avoided jumping.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Until one day when we all went to play
   <br/>
   On Jonny's new trampoline.
   <br/>
   On Stevie's first jump, the wave of his rump
   <br/>
   Sent him up till he couldn't be seen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a week, we heard Stevie speak
   <br/>
   On Jacqaline's walkie-talkie.
   <br/>
   "I've found the most amazing shows."
   <br/>
   So it's him we all try to copy.
