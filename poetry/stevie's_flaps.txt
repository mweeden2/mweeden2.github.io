stevie's flaps

My friend Stevie watched his TV
So much that his cheeks became flabby.
They bounced as he walked and waved as he talked,
And he completely avoided jumping.

Until one day when we all went to play
On Jonny's new trampoline.
On Stevie's first jump, the wave of his rump
Sent him up till he couldn't be seen.

After a week, we heard Stevie speak
On Jacqaline's walkie-talkie.
"I've found the most amazing shows."
So it's him we all try to copy.
