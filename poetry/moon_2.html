  <h3>
   moon 2
  </h3>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I found the white moon through the holey head
   <br/>
   Of the tree in my old neighbor's front yard.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She is largely hidden. The shining arc
   <br/>
   (it would be broad daylight if I stood there)
   <br/>
   Points like a broken compass down and East.
